/*
First time I saw this problem, I came up with a very troubling solution, and I got wrong. The side value is wrong and I
couldn't explain my algorithm clearly. During I thought about my solution, I found I made it diffcult.
Using a index denoting the positon to solve this problem is quite concise.
Using O(N) time, after going through the array, we get the answer.
